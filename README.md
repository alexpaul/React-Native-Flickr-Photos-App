## React-Native app (Flick Photos App) 

A react-native app that queries the Flickr API for searched photos and renders the results in a FlatList component. The rendered component that contains the image is a custom component called PhotoCard which has two additional Text components for rendering the title and description of the photo.

>NB: prior to running ```npm start``` or ```yarn start``` be sure to run ```npm install``` as the node_modules is being ignored by .gitignore
